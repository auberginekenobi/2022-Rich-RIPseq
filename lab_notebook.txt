Ran trimmomatic. Sequencing quality red flags. For most of the samples, a really
 high number of PE reads have only the forward read surviving. This means that
 the insert sequence is short. See https://www.biostars.org/p/325174/#325193 .

  2018. Uses STAR, MACS/MeTPeak. MeTPeak outperformed MACS but I don't have a 
  pipeline set up. Optimized for m6A-MeRIP-seq.

  2014. TopHat, Cufflinks, RIPSeeker. 

Fastqc
 Fastqc looks not great. IP11 analysis says 66% duplicates. Adapter content rises
 steadily from about 20bp. We will need to trim adapters, including reverse reads,
 deduplicate, and align by STAR, to see how many reads we are left with.
